# BantuPayCloneApp

A new Flutter project.
In this project, I was able to clone to a very large extent the UI of
the BantuPay App. Taking into consideration, details to the UI and sourcing
for assets that can match closely to the original app.

## Packages used
1. `flutter_screenutil`: used for adaptive screen responses, so that the UI will look relatively same in different screen sizes.
2. `modal_progress_hud_nsn`: used it to show a modal overlay on the screen when certain 
action is done.
3. `mobile_scanner`: used it for scanning purposes.
4. `curved_navigation_bar`: for the nice animated curved navigation bar.
5. `url_launcher`: to enable opening external web links from the app.

This project is a form of learning/practice for me to get acquianted with Flutter and
its technologies/powerfulness.

#### Worthy of note is that
- I built the UI out of my head, without any style guide, so there may be errors in pixels here and there :grin:
- I didn't use any state management packages, because as at the time of building this, I haven't learn't any.
- Some functionalities you may expect to see (depending on your level in tech) might not work, because i worked to the best of my skill set. :grin:
- Hopefully in the future, I might come back to this :smile:
- Some functionalities might misbehave as well due to the API level you are running on. :smile: I will have to learn to handle/manage different API levels
